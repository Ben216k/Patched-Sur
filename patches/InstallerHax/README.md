# Install Hax (by ASentientBot)

The macOS Installer checks the compatibility of a Mac before installing macOS. To bypass this, a Hax.dylib is injected into the installer which overrides the check. macOS has evolved since the original, so there are several varients.

- Hax1: The original
- Hax2: Some changes (I don't know what they are)
- Hax3-Original: Some more changes
- Hax3-BarryKN: BarryKN's fork of the Hax3 for his micropatcher with some changes.
- Hax4: An update to the original Hax3 that no longer injects into every single process, resulting in less random errors.
- Hax5: A version of Hax4 that works while booted into full Big Sur instead of a recovery environment.
- Hax6: A fixed version of Hax5 for macOS 11.3 beta 4 and up.

(Don't ask why it's call Hax, just go with it.)
